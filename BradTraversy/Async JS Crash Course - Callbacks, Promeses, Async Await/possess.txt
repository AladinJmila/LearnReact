Hey, what's going on guys. So this is going to be a Crash Course in 'asynchronous' JavaScript, so basically we're going to cover a couple different things. I want to cover 'callbacks' 'promises' and also 'async''await' syntax. Now these are all ways to deal with 'asynchronous' data, and what that means basically 'asynchronous' is when something is going on but you don't want to wait until that thing is done to continue your program, you want to continue while it's happening so it's happening asynchronously rather than 'synchronous' programming where something happens and you wait until it's completely finished until you move on to the next. Now 'asynchronous' programming is relevant to JavaScript because we're often making request to servers else where and it can take a couple of seconds to get you data back for instance. And you might not want your program to stall and wait for that data to come back, you want to keep going, keep doing something, so this is where 'callbacks' come in and 'callbacks' were used for a long time until ES6 was released or ES2015 where 'promises' were introduced to the language, and 'promises' give you a more elegant way the handle 'asynchronous' data. And then I think it was ES7, 'async''await' was introduced which is still dealing with promises just in a different way, you're dealing with the response in a way that is more elegant and it looks more like 'synchronous' programming, rather than using the '.then' and so on if you guys have ever used 'promises'. So we're gonna cover all those things, initially I was going to do a separate video on them, but I figured they're all relevant, we're going to use some of the same code on the 'callbacks' and 'promises' and you can see, what you have to do basically change it from a 'callback' to a 'promise'. we're also going to take a look at the 'promise''.all' if you are resolving multiple 'promises', you can do that, you know, call them all at the same time and wait for each one to be done.
And a lot of this code is actually from my 'Modern JavaScript from the beginning' on 'Udemy', 21 and half hour course on Vanilla JavaScript some core concepts, building projects. Check that course out, I will put a link in the description.

/***********************************************************************/

Alright, so let's get started here, I just have an 'index.html' file, I have a 'callback.js' and 'promises.js'. So we're gonna start with 'callbacks'.

So let's go over 'callbacks.js' and what we're going to do is we're going kind of mimic pope blogposts on a server and getting them and then creating a blog post, so we're just going to have an array and call it posts, and we'll have an array of two posts, these are just going to be objects, so 'title' Post One, and 'body' we'll say This is post one, and let's copy this down, we'll have one more post, so this will be Post Two.

/**Read code**/

And I realize that a lot of you guys might already know this stuff, but you know I like to create, you know, beginner to intermediate videos on my channel, so people just learning this stuff, you know, it's really important and I mean, there's not, a in my opinion a lot of great resources out there to learn this type of stuff, at least videos, you know there's a lot of documentation but a lot of people don't like documentation.
So what we want to do here is to create a function called 'getPosts', ok, now remember we're mimicking how it is to 'fetch' from a server and that can take a couple of seconds or whatever. So we're going to use 'setTimeout()' here, ok.
'setTimeout()' it takes in a 'callback' function so we could put a function in here, and then it takes in a certain amount of time where you want to delay whatever you put in here, so I'm going to delay it by a second, so we want 1000 , which is one thousand milliseconds.

/**Read code**/

Now you can use this syntax or you can use an arrow function which is what I'm going to do, so I'm going to remove the word 'function' and just put in an 'Arrow =>' just like that Okay. We'll keep this ES6 style.

/**Read code**/

So inside this 'setTimeout()'... The purpose of this is to get these posts here and then put them on the page. So let's create a variable called 'output', we're just going to initialize it to nothing.

/**Read code**/

And then we want to loop through the 'posts' so you could use a for loop here if you want, but I'm going to use the high order 'forEach()'. I'm going to say posts.forEach and this actually takes in a 'callback' as well, but I'm going to use an Arrow function, and then as far as a parameter goes, I'm going to say 'post', this could be anything, but I'm going to call it 'post' because that's what it is, aa, you can pass in an 'index' if you want, and then 'forEach''post' we want to add it to the 'output' variables. So let's say 'output' and we want to append so we say 'plus''equals', we'll use some 'back ticks' here, so that we can use 'template syntax' or 'literal' whatever it is. And then, we'll just put <li>s here, and I want the 'post' 'title', so I'm going to use this syntax so I can put a variable in. We'll take that 'post' from this right here. So basically we're iterating here, and then we can grab the 'title' or the 'body' so I'm just going to grab the 'title', so 'post.title'.

/**Read code**/

And then right after the 'forEach', not with in it, but right after the 'forEach' we want to insert it into the body so I'm going to say 'document.body.innerHTML', it doesn't really matter how we insert it here. And we're going to set that '=equal' to 'output'

/**Read code**/

Okay, so we need to actually call this function for it to work, so we'll say 'getPosts()' and let's save.
And then what happens is after a second, remember is has 'setTimeout' for a second, it's going to load the two 'posts', okay, it did great we get it here the 'posts' from the array and then we're looping through and then we're outputting them or we're putting them into the 'output' variable and then outputting that onto the page with this line.

Alright so, pretty easy.

Now let's create another function called 'createPost()', okay and this is going to take in a new 'post' that we pass in, and we want to do a 'setTimeout()' here as well, because remember  we're hypothetically dealing with a server, so let's say 'setTimout()', put an Arrow function, and then let's say this one takes 'two seconds' so 2000 milliseconds. And inside here all I want to do is take 'posts' and I want to push on to the 'posts' array the new post like that.

/**Read code**/

So, what do we want to happen we want to get the 'post' and then create a new one, that's is right. so let's do it, let's create 'post', and let's pass in here and boject with a 'title' and we'll just call it Post three, and the 'body' will say this is post three. Okay simple, we get the 'post' then we create the 'post', save, wait a minute, unexpected token, oh I forgot the function. Alright, so, here we go, post one and post two, now the reason we're not seeing post three is because the 'createPost()' to longer than the 'getPost()', the 'getPost()' happened in one second okay, our server returned in one second, the 'createPost()' however took two seconds, by the time we ran this 'createPost()' the DOM was already painted okay. So we can't do anything beyond that point, so this is where 'asynchronous' programming comes in and this is where 'callbacks' come in which is one way to handle it. So let's do that, let's actually make this work by using 'callback'. So this 'createPost()' here, what we do is we would actually have this take in a function and we'll call it 'callback' because you could essentially call it anything but this is common practice and you want that function to be called right after 'post' is pushed on. Okay so right here we'll say 'callback' like that and then all we have to do is now make this 'getPost()', this is 'callback' so that runs right after this is pushed not waiting two seconds for the entire function, so we can completely get rid of that and then add in the next second parameter of 'getPost()' like that okay, no parenthesis, and let's save and see what's happening. Okay, so what happened is it waited for two seconds and then it showed all the 'posts', and the reason it waited is because it had to wait to create the 'post' before it actually call the 'callback' Okay, so it had to push on to it and then call a 'callback' and this whole thing two seconds, but it adds the extra 'post' Okay. So this is a good example of how 'callbacks' work and why we use 'callbacks'

/**Read code**/

So, let's now look at 'promises' and I'm going to basically use the same code or start with the same code, so we don't need the actual call here, so let's grab the 'posts' and the two functions and let's put them into 'promises'. All right and let's change it in the 'index.html', we'll change this to 'promises.js'.

Okay, now to get 'posts' we're just going to leave that, but for create 'posts' what we want to do is instead of passing in a 'callback' we don't want to do that and we don't want to run the 'callback', instead we want to return a 'promise', so to do that simply return a new 'Promise' and then 'Promise' takes in a 'callback', I'm going to use an Arrow function and it takes in two parameters, so it takes in 'resolve' and 'reject', so basically when you want to 'resolve' a promise successfully, you call 'resolve', when something goes wrong, if you have some kind of error, you want to call 'reject'.

/**Read code**/

So we want to do the same functionality here, that we did, we just want to put this inside the new 'Promise' like that and to 'resolve', actually what we are going to do is create a variable and set it to 'false', normally this would do some error checking you don't have to but if you wanted to, you would do some kind of error checking and let's see if that is 'not true', so if no error then we simply want to 'resolve', when we 'resolve' our 'promise', 'else' then we want to 'reject' and we want to send a message just to say error: something went wrong. And that's not it, so let's go down here and let's 'createPost', let's pass in our actual 'post', so we'll say title Post three, and 'body' will say This is post three. Okay now we're not gonna pass in a 'callback' like 'getPost()', so we're not doing that anymore, this should return a 'Promise', meaning that we can now use the '.then' syntax, we can say '.then' and then in here we want to pass in 'getPosts' like that, all right, so let's try and run it, so we'll save and here we go.

/**Read code**/

So basically, it's waiting, it's going to set a 'timeout' and then as soon as it's done it's going to 'resolve' once it resolves then it'll call 'getPosts'. Okay now if we wanted an error message we can set it to 'true', so since it's set to true it's going to reject. Now if I save this and run it, you get uncaught 'error'. so the solution for this is you guys probably used this before, is the '.catch' so under the '.then', we want to do '.catch' and pass in 'error' and then let's just 'console.log' the error and save.

And now you see that we're actually getting a nice clean error rather than uncaught 'promise' or whatever.

For the most part in my experience, you're mostly going to be dealing with 'promises', so for instance when you use 'Fetch' API or 'Axios' or anything that uses 'promises', the 'Mongoose' library for DB for 'Node.js' uses 'promises', you know more and more libraries are using 'promises' now, so you're mostly going to be dealing with the 'response' rather than creating them yourselves but you should also know how to create them yourself, which is just basically new 'promise'.

/**Read code**/

So what I want to do now is look at 'promise.all' because if you have a lot of different 'promises' you don't want to keep having '.then', '.then'.

So you can use the 'promise.all' in that case so I'm going to comment out this call and let's go down here, let's actually change back to error to 'false' and let's look at 'promise', Okay, so let's just a bunch of 'promises', we say 'const' 'promise1' 'equal' 'Promise.resolve()', as long as we resolve it and we'll say 'Hello world', then we could say 'promise2', just set this to a variable if we wanted and then just give me different examples, we could say 'promise3' 'equals' 'new' 'Promise()' and we could pass in function with 'resolve' and 'reject', and let's do 'setTimout()' and we'll call 'resolve' and let's call that in two thousand milliseconds, and we'll just pass in 'Goodbye', Okay.
So now what we can do is we call 'Promise.all()' and what this does is it takes in an array of promises, so we have three of these up here, let's do 'promise1', 'promise2' and 'promise3', and then this will take a '.then', we want to do a 'dot' then we pass here our 'callback', so we'll use the Arrow function and will take in values like that, and then let's just 'console.log' 'values', all right let's see what happens, if I save this, so what happens is it gave us an array with the 'Hello world' so the first 'promise', the second which is just a number and then this one 'Goodbye' to which we actually set a 'timeout' two seconds, and that's why it tool two seconds, it's going to take however the longest 'promise' is that's how long it's going to take to actually show us the values.

/**Read code**/

Alright, just to add one more thing here, let's say 'const' 'promise4', for now we'll, I'm sure a lot of you guys have worker with the Fetch API to make Ajax calls or to make HTTP requests I should say which returns a 'promise', so let's Fetch from, let's see, the JSON type, a code or J what is it, it's JSON placeholder.typicode.com, and we can make a request to, let's say the users right here and get users, I'm going to grab that URL and pass it in here, now this return the 'promise', 'fetch()' is a little weird, because what happens is you need to do two .then()s when you use 'fetch()' because the first needs to format it usually to JSON and then the next '.then()' actually gives you the data, so if I keep it as is, and pass in 'promise4' and save, it's going to work but if we look at the response here we just get like this, weird stuff. What we want to do is for 'fetch()' we want to do '.then()' and we want to 'map' the 'response' to 'res.jason()' and now if we run it, it should give us the actual data which you can see right here is going to be ten users, alright. So that's 'promise.all', pretty easy.

/**Read code**/

Now let's look at, let's see, let's look at 'async await'. Okay, so I'm going to comment this out and  we don't want to change any of this stuff, I mean 'async await', it's a way to handle 'responses', it's not like a different way to write them or anything, basically we need to have a function that's labeled 'asynchronous', so let's go down here, actually we'll go above this because this 'promise.all()' has nothing to do with the code above it, let's say 'async / await'.
So what we want to do is create a function and call it 'init', now this function has to be labeled 'async' if we want to use 'await' inside of it, and 'await' does just that, it awaits for an 'asynchronous' process or action to complete, so what we will do is call 'createPost()', so I'm just going to copy this here without the '.then()', just simply the 'createPost()' with the 'title' and the 'body' passed in, except we want to call right before it 'await', Okay, and after that we can just simply call 'getPosts()', so we're waiting for this to be done, until we move on and call this. So now we just need to call 'init()', and save and we should see them pop on the screen and there we go.
Alright, so that how 'async await' works, it's just a more elegant way to handle 'promises'.

/**Read code**/

Now if we want to use it like, let's say with 'fetch()' we could do that as well.
So I'll go ahead and comment that out. Let's go out of here, let's say: 'async' 'await' with 'fetch. Okay let's copy what we did here, just grab that, and we're going to need an 'async' function, let's just call this, we'll say, function 'fetchUseres()', and we want to call that 'fetch' except we want to put this into a variable and let's call it 'response' or 'res' and set it to 'await' 'fetch', cause remember this returns a 'promise'. Now, again the 'fetch' API is a little weird because the first 'promise' it returns is going to tell we're going to call 'res.json()' on that, so what we need to do is create another variable called 'data' and set it to 'res.json()', and then we can 'console.log()' the 'data', so let's save that, and it's not going to do anything because we didn't call it, so let's call 'fetchUsers()' and save, and there we go, so we should get 10 users, Okay.

/**Read code**/

So it's just a cleaner way of dealing with 'promises', instead of doing the '.then' and all that stuff, especially with 'fetch' makes it look even nicer. We just have these variables and everything is just after the other, there's no '.then' or '.whatever' and it's cleaner than 'callbacks' as well.

So, I mean that's pretty much it guys, I wanted to cover the basics, and kind of you know, for those of you that weren't really wrapping your head around this stuff, and I know a lot of you already know this and that's fine, you know a refresher never hurts. But that's going to be it guys.
So I am working on some longer form content, some projects, some View.js, UX stuff, some React stuff, Some of the Django, Laravel, so stay tuned for that, it's just taking me a little while to get some stuff together and to get some dealings in order in my personal life, and you know guys if you watched my last video, it tells you a little bit of what's going on.
But thanks for watching, hopefully you liked this, if you did please leave a 'like' and I will see you in the next video.
