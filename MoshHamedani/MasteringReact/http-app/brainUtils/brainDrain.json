  "drain2": "I added more glue to the keyboard and mouse work table and left to dry outside with weights on it, I'm hoping that one would steal the weights, I'm keeping a watch because my Tunisian part of the brain is anxious.",

  "drain3": "It just accured to me that there is a good amount of waisted time in transitioning between the different pahses of the learning sessions. If this can be automated so the necessary tools would automatically pop up when their turn comes, it will save a time, or at least you can waste time by choice not as a result of following the learning flow.",

  "drain4": "I just took a shower and waisted a good amount of time, so I would really like if I stick to the work plan so I can finish it on time. I need to reach at least half the course today (hopefully more), so I can finish this chapter tomorrow around 5pm.",

  "drain5": "Random thoughts keep coming during meditation, but once I'm done they are no longer here. Funny monkey brain, I really have little control over it yet it does so much very well.

  "drain6": "This error logging website and whole process is annoying me because it's completely different from the course and I can't get it to work easily. It's going to cost me time to fix but I'd rather advance witht the course instead. Yeah sure, it will be benificial so I don't have to deal with it some other day, but what can I say, I can't deny that I don't have positive feelings toward this situation for the time being. Hopefully that will change."
